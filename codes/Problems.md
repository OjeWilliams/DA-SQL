#1: MoM Percent Change 

*Context:* Oftentimes it's useful to know how much a key metric, such as monthly active users, changes between months. Say we have a table logins in the form: 
| user_id | date       |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | 2018-07-01 |
| 234     | 2018-07-02 |
| 3       | 2018-07-02 |
| 1       | 2018-07-02 |
| ...     | ...        |
| 234     | 2018-10-04 |

**Task**: Find the month-over-month percentage change for monthly active users (MAU).
